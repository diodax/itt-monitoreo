gulp + nodemon + convenience\n\n## Install \n\n```bash\n$ npm install --save-dev gulp-nodemon\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nGulp-nodemon looks almost exactly like regular nodemon, but it's made for use with gulp tasks.\n\n### **nodemon([options])**\n\nYou can pass an object to gulp-nodemon with options [like you would in nodemon config](https://github.com/remy/nodemon#config-files).\n\nExample below will start `server.js` in `development` mode and watch for changes, as well as watch all `.html` and `.js` files in the directory.\n```javascript\ngulp.task('start', function () {\n  nodemon({\n    script: 'server.js'\n  , ext: 'js html'\n  , env: { 'NODE_ENV': 'development' }\n  })\n})\n```\n\n## Synchronous Build Tasks\n\n*NOTE: This feature requires Node v0.12 because of `child_process.spawnSync`.*\n\nNodemon is powerful but lacks the ability to compile/cleanup code prior to restarting the application... until now! Most build systems can never be complete without compilation, and now it works harmoniously with your nodemon loop.\n\n### **{ tasks: [Array || Function(changedFiles)] }**\n\nIf you want to lint your code when you make changes that's easy to do with a simple event. But what if you need to wait while your project re-builds before you start it up again? This isn't possible with vanilla nodemon, and can be tedious to implement yourself, but it's easy with gulp-nodemon:\n```javascript\nnodemon({\n  script: 'index.js'\n, tasks: ['browserify']\n})\n```\n\nWhat if you want to decouple your build processes by language? Or even by file? Easy, just set the `tasks` option to a function. Gulp-nodemon will pass you the list of changed files and it'll let you return a list of tasks you want run.\n```javascript\nnodemon({\n  script: './index.js'\n, ext: 'js css'\n, tasks: function (changedFiles) {\n    var tasks = []\n    changedFiles.forEach(function (file) {\n      if (path.extname(file) === '.js' && !~tasks.indexOf('lint')) tasks.push('lint')\n      if (path.extname(file) === '.css' && !~tasks.indexOf('cssmin')) tasks.push('cssmin')\n    })\n    return tasks\n  }\n})\n```\n\n## Events\n\ngulp-nodemon returns a stream just like any other NodeJS stream, **except for the `on` method**, which conveniently accepts gulp task names in addition to the typical function.\n\n### **.on([event], [Array || Function])**\n\n1. `[event]` is an event name as a string. See [nodemon events](https://github.com/remy/nodemon/blob/master/doc/events.md).\n2. `[tasks]` An array of gulp task names or a function to execute.\n\n## Examples\n\n### Basic Usage\n\nThe following example will run your code with nodemon, lint it when you make changes, and log a message when nodemon runs it again.\n\n```javascript\n// Gulpfile.js\nvar gulp = require('gulp')\n  , nodemon = require('gulp-nodemon')\n  , jshint = require('gulp-jshint')\n\ngulp.task('lint', function () {\n  gulp.src('./**/*.js')\n    .pipe(jshint())\n})\n\ngulp.task('develop', function () {\n  nodemon({ script: 'server.js'\n          , ext: 'html js'\n          , ignore: ['ignored.js']\n          , tasks: ['lint'] })\n    .on('restart', function () {\n      console.log('restarted!')\n    })\n})\n```\n\n### Bunyan Logger integration\n\nThe [bunyan](https://github.com/trentm/node-bunyan/) logger includes a `bunyan` script that beautifies JSON logging when piped to it. Here's how you can you can pipe your output to `bunyan` when using `gulp-nodemon`:\n\n```javascript\ngulp.task('run', ['default', 'watch'], function() {\n    var nodemon = require('gulp-nodemon'),\n        spawn   = require('child_process').spawn,\n        bunyan\n\n    nodemon({\n        script: paths.server,\n        ext:    'js json',\n        ignore: [\n            'var/',\n            'node_modules/'\n        ],\n        watch:    [paths.etc, paths.src],\n        stdout:   false,\n        readable: false\n    })\n    .on('readable', function() {\n\n        // free memory\n        bunyan && bunyan.kill()\n\n        bunyan = spawn('./node_modules/bunyan/bin/bunyan', [\n            '--output', 'short',\n            '--color'\n        ])\n\n        bunyan.stdout.pipe(process.stdout)\n        bunyan.stderr.pipe(process.stderr)\n\n        this.stdout.pipe(bunyan.stdin)\n        this.stderr.pipe(bunyan.stdin)\n    });\n})\n```\n\n## Using `gulp-nodemon` with React, Browserify, Babel, ES2015, etc.\n\nGulp-nodemon is made to work with the \"groovy\" new tools like Babel, JSX, and other JavaScript compilers/bundlers/transpilers.\n\nIn gulp-nodemon land, you'll want one task for compilation that uses an on-disk cache (e.g. `gulp-file-cache`, `gulp-cache-money`) along with your bundler (e.g. `gulp-babel`, `gulp-react`, etc.). Then you'll put `nodemon({})` in another task and pass the entire compile task in your config:\n\n```javascript\nvar gulp = require('gulp')\n  , nodemon = require('gulp-nodemon')\n  , babel = require('gulp-babel')\n  , Cache = require('gulp-file-cache')\n\nvar cache = new Cache();\n\ngulp.task('compile', function () {\n  var stream = gulp.src('./src/**/*.js') // your ES2015 code\n                   .pipe(cache.filter()) // remember files\n                   .pipe(babel({ ... })) // compile new ones\n                   .pipe(cache.cache()) // cache them\n                   .pipe(gulp.dest('./dist')) // write them\n  return stream // important for gulp-nodemon to wait for completion\n})\n\ngulp.task('watch', ['compile'], function () {\n  var stream = nodemon({\n                 script: 'dist/' // run ES5 code\n               , watch: 'src' // watch ES2015 code\n               , tasks: ['compile'] // compile synchronously onChange\n               })\n\n  return stream\n})\n```\n\nThe cache keeps your development flow moving quickly and the `return stream` line ensure that your tasks get run in order. If you want them to run async, just remove that line.\n\n## Using `gulp-nodemon` with `browser-sync`\n\nSome people want to use `browser-sync`. That's totally fine, just start browser sync in the same task as `nodemon({})` and use gulp-nodemon's `.on('start', function () {})` to trigger browser-sync. Don't use the `.on('restart')` event because it will fire before your app is up and running.\n","maintainers":[{"name":"jacksongariety","email":"personal@jacksongariety.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2016-06-08T16:33:32.126Z","created":"2014-01-05T23:40:52.564Z","0.0.1":"2014-01-05T23:40:52.564Z","0.0.2":"2014-01-08T04:38:58.210Z","0.0.3":"2014-01-08T07:50:32.356Z","0.1.0":"2014-01-12T22:57:47.539Z","0.1.1":"2014-01-12T23:02:50.347Z","0.1.2":"2014-01-22T05:55:15.423Z","1.0.0":"2014-02-21T06:12:47.470Z","1.0.1":"2014-03-09T19:59:25.843Z","1.0.2":"2014-03-09T20:00:37.699Z","1.0.3":"2014-05-18T19:35:45.277Z","1.0.4":"2014-06-05T08:58:34.403Z","1.0.5":"2015-01-07T20:46:17.513Z","2.0.0":"2015-03-19T10:31:50.341Z","2.0.1":"2015-03-20T00:44:30.032Z","2.0.2":"2015-03-20T00:52:13.134Z","2.0.3":"2015-04-30T20:30:10.051Z","2.0.4":"2015-08-21T17:19:22.458Z","2.0.5":"2015-12-28T17:33:31.224Z","2.0.6":"2015-12-28T17:53:42.399Z","2.0.7":"2016-05-10T00:41:20.314Z","2.1.0":"2016-06-08T16:33:32.126Z"},"readmeFilename":"README.md","homepage":"https://github.com/JacksonGariety/gulp-nodemon","keywords":["gulp","nodemon","develop","server","restart","automatically","watch","gulpfriendly","gulpplugin"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+https://github.com/JacksonGariety/gulp-nodemon.git"},"author":{"name":"Jackson Gariety"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/JacksonGariety/gulp-nodemon/issues"},"license":"BSD-2-Clause","users":{"unkleara":true,"jacksongariety":true,"antoniobrandao":true,"mswanson1524":true,"furier":true,"hal9zillion":true,"kabomi":true,"codeshrew":true,"bolerovt":true,"awzm":true,"johnheroy":true,"giovanniramos":true,"pobrien":true,"phoenix-xsy":true,"itonyyo":true,"mpcjazz":true,"alansouzati":true,"detj":true,"tonydieu":true,"chrisjordanme":true,"iahmadzain":true,"jyounce":true,"hsrob":true,"wkaifang":true,"dwayneford":true,"seantunwin":true,"frankg":true,"hckhanh":true,"jalcine":true,"pensierinmusica":true,"christopher.urquidi":true,"iolo":true,"crazyjingling":true,"martinezi":true,"nestof":true,"bourne":true,"flynntsc":true,"fadihania":true,"arayzou":true,"ovrmrw":true,"artivilla":true,"bian17888":true,"djamseed":true,"dosevader":true,"bruinebeer":true,"tpolyak":true,"roobottom":true,"hypo9eal":true,"markthethomas":true,"peunzhang":true,"shaddyhm":true,"snarky":true,"polarisjunior":true,"mate2":true,"demod":true,"wangnan0610":true,"soulchainer":true,"hy20090501":true,"pablo.tavarez":true,"makknife":true,"stephenhuh":true,"knoja4":true,"xyyjk":true,"zerosandones":true,"mobeicaoyuan":true},"_attachments":{},"_etag":"\"B27117MXDE3RBLN9LC5VVFRUP\""}
